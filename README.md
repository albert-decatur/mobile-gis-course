# mobile-gis-course

Your smartphone can do GIS!
This course teaches you how.

[But you need a smartphone.]
Android or iOS are possible OSes, but Android is preferred.
All apps are free.

### Resources


#### mobile

* [Mapillary](http://blog.mapillary.com/)
  * take geotagged photos to build an open source street view
* [geopaparazzi](https://geopaparazzi.github.io/geopaparazzi/)
  * overlay your own . . .
    * MBTiles files
      * your own web maps!
    * GPX tracks
      * vector!
    * SpatiaLite layers
      * raster and vector in a SQL database!
    * or load a web map tile source by URL
      * but seriously you want to take advantage of that offline goodness
  * digitize!
  * take photos and notes!
    * but you should really be taking your photos with Mapillary
  * record GPX!
* MapBox
  * for iOS only - the Android one just displays web map tiles for now


#### on the web

* [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/)
  * digitize vectors, upload, add attributes, and share
* [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
  * MapBox Studio - vector tile styling
  * [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) - still awesome for making MBTiles files
* [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/)
  * easiest possible way to make a web map
    * even animate with torque if you have a timestamp field
* [uMap](http://umap.openstreetmap.co/en/)
  * easy web maps
* [geocolor.io](http://geocolor.io/)
  * like geojson.io but for choropleth maps

  * routing with OpenStreetMap


#### utils of awesome

  * [geojson-merge](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-merge)
    * exactly what it says.  love that.
